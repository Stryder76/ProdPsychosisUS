# ProdPsychosisUS
This repository is my hosting location and publication of the user script I made from [@Lord_Vlad](https://habitica.com/profile/ce36e72e-50fd-4e98-908b-34b3c06e9664)'s orginal [challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/074dec30-252f-42aa-9dc8-a6462b982a59) and user script. I do not own the copyright and have his permission to have this repo.

The Userscript includes 3 checklist items that are automatically created if they don't already exist, they are automatically checked off if the conditions are true, if they are not true, the negative habit gets ticked a number of times based on the checklist item, I won't repeat that as it's already in the [challenge description](https://habitica.com/challenges/4867732f-4019-4880-823e-5f3a178acea8)

Setup guide:

Make a google app script, this [guide](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Google_Apps_Script#Simulate_Poison_Damage) can help
Copy the [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stryder76/ProdPsychosisUS/main/code.gs) and put it into the google app script
Setup a trigger to repeat either daily on a range of hours or at a specific hourly interval, the trigger section is right below the code section.

The rest of the setup guide is contained inline in the code, you should be fine. Feel free to start an issue if you need anything.

I plan on adding another guide for adding your own checklist items and a public to-do list here(possibly in a seperate file)
